  abstract =  {Let (x1, x2, ?, xn) be independent realizations of a random variable taking values on a circle C of unit circumference, and let Tn = n-1 ?1 0 [ ?n j=1 f(x + xj) - n ]2 dx, where f(x) is a probability density on C, f ? L2[ 0, 1 ], and the addition x + xj is performed modulo 1. Tn is used to test whether the observations are uniformly distributed on C. It includes as special cases several other statistics previously proposed for this purpose by Ajne, Rayleigh and Watson. The main results of the paper are the asymptotic distributions of Tn under fixed alternatives to uniformity and under sequences of local alternatives to uniformity. A characterization is found for those alternatives against which Tn, with specified f(x), gives a consistent test. The approximate Bahadur slope of Tn is calculated from the asymptotic null distribution; however, an example indicates that this slope may not always reflect the power of Tn reliably. A Monte Carlo simulation for a special case of Tn suggests that a fair approximation to the power of Tn may be obtained from its mean and variance under the alternative.},

  abstract =  {In many environmental and agricultural studies, data are collected on both linear
and circular random variables, with possible dependence between the variables. Classi-
cally, the analysis of such data has been carried out in a classical regression framework.
We propose a Bayesian hierarchical framework to handle all forms of uncertainty aris-
ing in a linear–circular data set. One novelty of our multivariate linear–circular model
is that, marginally, the circular component is assumed to be a mixture model with an
unknown number of von Mises (or circular normal) distributions. We use the Dirich-
let process to introduce variability in the model dimensionality, and develop a simple
Gibbs sampling algorithm for simulating the mixture components. Although we illus-
trate our methodology on von Mises mixtures, it is widely applicable. We thus avoid
complicated reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, which are consid-
ered ideal for analyzing mixtures of unknown number of distributions. We illustrate
our methodologies with simulated and real data sets. Using pseudo-Bayes factors, we
also compare different models associated with both fixed and variable numbers of von
Mises distributions. Our findings suggest that models associated with varying numbers
ofmixturecomponentsperformatleastaswellasthosewithknownnumbersofmixture
components. We tentatively argue that model averaging associated with variable num-
ber of mixture components improves the model’s predictive power, which compensates
for the lack of knowledge of the actual number of mixture components.},

  abstract = {Nonparametric density and regression estimation methods for circular data are included in the R package NPCirc. Specifically, a circular kernel density estimation procedure is provided, jointly with different alternatives for choosing the smoothing parameter. In the regression setting, nonparametric estimation for circular-linear, circular-circular and linear-circular data is also possible via the adaptation of the classical Nadaraya-Watson and local linear estimators. In order to assess the significance of the features observed in the smooth curves, both for density and regression with a circular covariate and a linear response, a SiZer technique is developed for circular data, namely CircSiZer. Some data examples are also included in the package, jointly with a routine that allows generating mixtures of different circular distributions.},
