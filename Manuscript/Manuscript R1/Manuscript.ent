macro:->The
selection
of
the
origin
in
circumplex
data
depends
on
the
scaling
of
the
Agency
and
Communion
scores.
Agency
and
Communion
are
measured
on
a
scale
from
1
to
5
and
for
analysis
purposes
they
are
later
converted
to
scale
ranging
from
-1
to
1.
Their
respective
0
scores
form
the
origin.
Scaling
is
however
only
considered
an
issue
in
those
instances
where
cylindrical
data
is
derived
from
measurements
in
bivariate
space.

it

In
